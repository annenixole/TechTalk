   <h2 id="James"> Here's James Gosling, the founder of the well-known programming language Java. In the interview, he discusses his motivation for creating the programming language.</h2>

   <p id="Gosling">James Gosling, the father of Java, one of the world's most widely used programming languages, has
    talked with research scientist Lex Fridman about Java's origins and his motivations for creating a language that
    would be used on tens of billions of devices and become central to the development of Android at Google.

    Gosling designed Java 27 years ago while at Sun Microsystems. In 2009, Java would be one of the key reasons Oracle
    acquired Sun. According to Oracle, today there are 51 billion active Java Virtual Machines (JVMs) deployed globally.
  </p>

  <p id="Gosling2"> "It was all about what was happening in terms of computing hardware, processors and networking that
    was outside the computing industry," he said.

    "That was everything from the early glimmers of cell phones that were happening then to – you look at elevators and
    locomotives and process-control systems in factories and all kinds of audio and video equipment.

    "They all had processors in them, they were all doing stuff with them and it felt like there was something going on
    there that we needed to understand."

    At that stage, C and C++ "absolutely owned the universe" and everything was being written in those languages. </p>

            flattening. India currently has some 650 million smartphone users but the pace of growth has slowed. Sale of
            mobile phones fell to 151 million units last year, down from a peak of 168 million in 2021, according to
            Counterpoint, a market research firm. A single-digit growth in sales is predicted this year.

          <div class="slide-title">For Tech Companies, Years of Easy Money Yield to Hard Times</div>
          <div class="slide-text"> Eighteen months ago, the online used car retailer Carvana had such great prospects
            that it was worth $80 billion. Now it is valued at less than $1.5 billion, a 98 percent plunge, and is
            struggling to survive.

            Many other tech companies are also seeing their fortunes reverse and their dreams dim. They are shedding
            employees, cutting back, watching their financial valuations shrivel — even as the larger economy chugs
            along with a low unemployment rate and a 3.2 percent annualized growth rate in the third quarter.
